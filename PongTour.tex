On this day, March 17 in the year of our Lord, games will be held in Juno's honor. In order to honor the gods a ritual sacrifice of chips and salsa will be made. The games themselves shall have four, not three, nor five, but four teams of two. If the games should have anything but four teams may Zues strike us down from the heavens. The rules of this honorable tournament our as follows: \\
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item The cups will be filled with water as a representation of the cleanlinest of our Kingdom.
      \item A goblet of beer, wine, or liquid of the mixed variety must be equiped by each participant.
      \item The first round will be in the form of a round-robin in which each team must compete against every other team.
      \item Whichever two teams have the best record move on two the final round of the tournament.
      \item There will be an honorless loser final in order to determine third place.
      \item In case of a tie in the round-robin stage the two tied teams will compete in a three cup shootout,
      \item One member of the losing team must take a shotgun to the face. (of the beer variety, not the Kurt Cobain kind)
      \item The rules of the game itself follow thusly. No re-racks straight-up honorable pong, with bounce cup due to popular vote. Rollbacks are in effect, meaning if cups are made by both members of a team the balls are returned to the orignal shooters.
    \end{enumerate}
   
These are the rules as I decree, any changes shall be voted on by the people (majority rules). May the losers all be subject to eternal blackout.
